## Methodology

1. **Data Loading**: Integrated 4 data sources (general HR, manager survey, employee survey, working hours)
2. **Exploratory Analysis**: Comprehensive EDA identifying patterns and relationships
3. **Preprocessing**: Cleaning, encoding, feature engineering, handling imbalance
4. **Model Development**: Trained and compared 7 different ML models
5. **Model Selection**: Chose best model based on ROC-AUC and other metrics
6. **Interpretation**: Feature importance analysis and SHAP values
7. **Recommendations**: Actionable insights for reducing turnover

## Expected Outcomes

### For the Company
- Identification of key factors driving turnover
- Predictive model for at-risk employees
- Data-driven recommendations for retention
- Cost savings from reduced turnover

### For Employees
- Improved workplace conditions
- Better work-life balance
- Clear career development paths
- Enhanced job satisfaction

## Next Steps

1. **Place Data Files**: Add CSV and ZIP files to `data/` directory
2. **Run Analysis**: Execute the Jupyter notebook
3. **Review Results**: Analyze model performance and insights
4. **Prepare Presentation**: Use presentation outline as guide
5. **Implement Recommendations**: Work with HR to implement suggested interventions

## Technical Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, xgboost, lightgbm, shap, matplotlib, seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook
- ~4GB RAM recommended for full analysis

## Time Estimates

- **Setup**: 15-30 minutes
- **Notebook Execution**: 30-60 minutes (depending on hardware)
- **Review and Customization**: 2-4 hours
- **Presentation Preparation**: 4-6 hours

## Notes

- All code is well-documented with comments
- Random seeds set to 42 for reproducibility
- Model performance will be displayed after execution
- Working hours data processing is optional (handles missing data gracefully)
- Ethics and bibliography documents are comprehensive and ready for submission
